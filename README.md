BEFORE PROCEEDING: This README assumes that you HAVE INSTALLED the following on your machine:
1. Node.js 
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB Community Server
4. MongoDB Compass

If you have not installed everything that is mentioned above, do install them first and come back
to this after. 

----------------- How to Use ------------------
1. Download the Phase2 folder on this repository.
2. Then, open MongoDB compass.
3. You should see "New Connection", and in the URI textbox below, paste this: mongodb+srv://masterUser122:Y6SDtkXn09rMDZTO@cluster0.req0igx.mongodb.net/
4. Click connect, and you should be able to see a schema called "lab_reserve", click on that.
  (If you want to test registration, go to users collection and you should see the info added there after registering.
5. DO NOT CLOSE MonggoDB Compass, and open your terminal/command prompt.
6. CD to the path of Phase2 on your machine
7. After that, start the server by typing "node server.js" on your command prompt/terminal, and if succesfull, you should see these:
  Server running on port 3000
  Connected to MongoDB Atlas :)
8. If you don't see that, message me. If you do see that, go to your preffered web browser.
9. In your web browser, enter: localhost:3000
10. After entering, you should see the frontend website.
11. For now, only the registration is implemented. Other features will be implemented soon.
12. You can go to the register and after registering, you should be able to see the info added on the mongodb compass :)

That's it for now :)))) HAPPY CODING!
